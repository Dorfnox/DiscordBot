# WaffleBot
A Discord Bot that scrapes stats.gats.io for stats, plays music, and does other cool things!


## Features

### Gats Stats!

> Scrapes https://stats.gats.io/ and can return most of it's data! Examples of queries look like:
> `waffle playerstats dorfnox`
> `w ps MEADOWVOID`
> `ðŸ§‡ clanstats KCSS`
> `w best snipers`
> `w top kills`
> `w top5` < Returns the current top five players on the daily leaderboard (including fun facts!).

### Music!
> Plays and queues up to 12 songs (currently - more server-configs available in future!)

### WaffleMail
> DM WaffleBot to open a channel directly to staff of a server. Better than receiving individual pings from members!

### WaffleBomber
> Tired of finessing your admin rights for bots to not show up in a channel? Activate the WaffleBomber using `w screwbots` to hire the wafflebomber to destroy all other bot messsages clogging up a channel

### ... And Plenty More Features
> Try `w help` for a list of other features. For example, `w help music` will give you a list of music commands!
